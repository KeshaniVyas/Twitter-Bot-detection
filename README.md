# Twitter-Bot-detection

I have applied following machine learning algorithms for bot detection in Twitter data. I have considered few features for classification and few bag of words for detecting account as bot or not.

  1). Random Forest
  2). Logistic Regression
  3). Naive Bayes
  4). Decision Tree
 
 Testdata_classify.csv gives the result for the account whether it is bot or not.
